### Context the question.

The question in the title it´s related to living experiences in a development team after a change of government, change of rulers, managers, area chiefs; in the public sector this type of situation appears frequently, especially in LATAM countries. This on occasions isn’t a bad idea, the changes it's necessary but the way to do them and the actions executed it´s the difference.

In my collaboration in a public institution on one occasion at the start of a new year, the development team received an invitation to use all the possible open-source solutions for development and related tasks. After reading the document I saw that on this occasion the principal reason for the government was the reduction of cost.

### The impact and the reaction to the notice.

Receive this notice certainly took us by surprise however motivate the team to realize an analysis of the current situation. The next step consisted in to ask us some questions for example:

- what would happen if canceled all licenses of private software?
- how long time would it take us to migrate to open-source technology?
- are we ready to do something like this?

This step allowed us to review the existent vulnerabilities related to private software and Solve these questions it allowed us to identify opportunities and goals.

### Before of step into action

Establish the objectives allow clarifying the goal which we want to reach. So, having clear the vulnerabilities and opportunities the next step was planning. The planning is the drawing of a way that will lead us to the objectives.
We do not complicate ourselves and decide to describe actions for the short, medium, and long term.
One of the planning tasks consisted of use .Net Core but why?
At this moment we were working full with .Net Framework and the natural step was this, however, I conducted a technical study.

### How do we carry it out?

Many of the things we had worked on were in a production environment and they worked well. So, we decided to apply a basic principle: “if it works, don´t touch it” but gain experience and only attend short-term tasks and attend medium-term activities only when the recommendation becomes official.

Since we had a plan, we reviewed the tasks described in the plan had distributed them to the team members according to their abilities.

The systems that were in operation continued like this, but new processes began to be attended with open-source technology. In this way, we gain experience.

With this, the team turned a surprise requirement into a learning and preparation process for the future.
