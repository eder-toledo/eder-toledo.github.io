      I conducted an analysis of the relationships among the five units of
      'ECOSUR' based on their involvement in research projects. To perform this
      analysis, I utilized <b>Logstash</b>, <b>Elasticsearch</b>, and <b>Kibana</b> as the
      foundational technologies for data extraction, transformation, loading,
      and the creation of an interactive dashboard. Through the use of
      visualizations, including networks depicting connections between units and
      individuals, as well as tables highlighting key responsible parties and
      participants, I was able to clearly present the significant connections
      between each unit.

      API for the automatic management of <b>Docker</b> containers. The goal was to 
      allow web application users to create their own development environments 
      for geospatial analysis. Through a <b>Traefik</b> environment, <b>Nginx</b>, <b>Prometheus</b> 
      was allowed to deploy its environment with an automatically generated 
      domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of my involvement in the project, I conducted an analysis of
      collaboration networks among departments and groups within "ECOSUR."
      Leveraging <b>Logstash</b>, <b>Elasticsearch</b>, and <b>Kibana</b>, I performed a
      comprehensive analysis and developed a comprehensive dashboard to answer
      the question: "What is the nature of the relationships among different
      levels of academic organization?" Through the use of interactive networks
      and tables showcasing relevant responsible parties and participants, I
      gained a profound understanding of the relationships between various
      departments and research groups within the institution.

    <p>
      I undertook a data analysis project focused on tweets related to the 8M
      and 9M movements. Employing technologies such as <b>NodeRed</b>, <b>Kibana</b>, and
      <b>Elasticsearch</b>, I executed data ingestion, transformation, and the
      development of an interactive dashboard. By visualizing daily tweet
      counts, word clouds, and location maps, I provided a comprehensive
      overview of the impact of these movements on social media. Additionally, I
      identified potential bot accounts and influential individuals, offering
      relevant insights into the scope and influence of the movements.

    <p>
      Within the realm of banking security, I actively participated in a project
      aimed at detecting fraud in banking systems. Utilizing technologies
      including <b>Kubernetes</b>, <b>Docker</b>, <b>Logstash</b>, <b>Kibana</b>, and <b>Elasticsearch</b>, I
      conducted meticulous analyses of extensive datasets. Through visual
      representations such as transaction maps and correlations between
      transactions, I successfully identified suspicious patterns with a Machine
      Learning plugin, presenting them in a detailed table of potentially
      fraudulent activities. Furthermore, I played a pivotal role in test
      development and the creation of multiple dashboards to enhance monitoring
      and enable early detection of fraudulent behavior.

    <p>
      As part of the "Holistic Risk Index for COVID19" project, I performed data
      analysis tasks to assess the risk of COVID-19 transmission within
      populations of flower growers and coffee growers. Employing <b>Logstash</b>,
      <b>Kibana</b>, and <b>Elasticsearch</b>, I managed data ingestion, transformation, and
      the creation of a comprehensive dashboard. By employing visualizations
      such as gender-based pie charts, location maps, and risk index bars, I
      provided insights into the risk of contagion within these agricultural
      communities. Furthermore, I presented pertinent details concerning
      products associated with risk and provided breakdowns by age groups.
