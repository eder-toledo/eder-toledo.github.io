    with experience in the field of software engineering. I have worked on a

  <p>
    My recent <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}projects.html">projects</a> are mainly
    focused on data analysis for decision-making. I believe that data is a
    powerful tool for better understanding users and improving the user
    experience. I strive to create applications that are easy to use and offer
    an exceptional user experience.

    Currently in my free time I am exploring my facet as an Indie Creator, with
    the goal of improving my skills in analysis, agile execution and creative
    process.

  <p>
    I have worked with different programming languages but I have more
    experience with C# and JavaScript, mainly focusing on web development. I
    have also given lectures on the JavaScript programming language and
    development on the Android platform.
